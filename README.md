# SelfDriving-Toy-Duck
This is the code for my A-level computing project, and is still under development...visit https://jakentech.github.io/Blog/Posts/Duck/A-LevelDuck.html  to find out a bit more about this wired project!
All Duck related images are from Stick Png.
I have used https://github.com/rodrigocava/mrrobot as a guide for this project (Mainly as I have no idea what I am really doing). It's a really good base for the code so Thanks! https://medium.com/@rodrigocava/i-built-my-own-self-driving-rc-car-1b269fc02e6c is the blog post that links to the github code! 
The duck has just turned one! Happy Birthday Duck!
