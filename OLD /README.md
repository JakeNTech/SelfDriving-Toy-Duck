# SelfDriving-Toy-Duck
This is the code for my A-level computing project, and is still under development...visit bit.ly/JakeNTech to find out a bit more about this wired project
All Duck related images are from Stick Png.
Note: This is currently an ongoing project.
I have used https://github.com/rodrigocava/mrrobot as a guide for this project (Mainly as I have no idea what I am really doing)
