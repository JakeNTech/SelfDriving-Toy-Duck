			<p1>For my A-level computer science project I decided to make a self driving duck..although thats not how this all started. Let me take you on a little journy!</p1>
			<br><br>
			<p>The first idea I had was to make a AI-sign recognition, like all new cars have, and relay that to a used using text to speech and a simple tinkter GUI; the only issue was this was too simple, it could have been done with only 50 lines of code so after some digging arround that was thrown off the table.</p>
			<p>A few days later, and with <b>no drink involved</b>, I thought <i>"What about making a self-driving little tikes car? It uses the same priciples as the sign recognition and would also be a huge riot"</i> Jummping on google saw me looking at little tikes cars for a fiver near our house; then it hit me, like a big wall, somehow I would need to fill in the gap, join the front wheels together and make some kind of steering setup and then find a way to power it...A golf cart motor costs ~£170 plus the cost of a car battery to power it and then a load-balanacing charger to well...charge it. The next idea was to make a self-driving RC car, that would be safer, cheaper and easier to get to school! It was a good idea but then...</p>
			<br>
			<p><i>It's worth pointing out at this point that our computer science class has a massive obbsession with ducks!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>I bought the only RC duck,<sub>At the time of purchase, and on ebay</sub>,in the UK...<b>for only £15</b>(+ p&p)! I must say when it arrived I was genuenly supprised how big it was!</p>
